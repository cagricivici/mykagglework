My works are accumulated here as Kaggle repository. To be short summary;
- feature engineering to get good score. EDA and PCA and co-occurance was used.
- Pipeline, dataloader&dataset was used for train, test and validation data.
- Image Augmentation is common-used methods for especially CNN works.
- work on Pytorch, Keras Tensorflow for big data processing in model training, validating and testing phase.
- used devices are CPU, GPU and also TPU.
- transfer learning is used such as YOLO, Resnet. some parameters in some of them was frozen in training, some of them was unfrozen so that it would learn more.
